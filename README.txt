the data comes from a Kaggle project: https://www.kaggle.com/c/tmdb-box-office-prediction/data

but I guarantee you that I have never viewed or used any existing work from other people, by the time I finish and submit this project to you.

it's a TMDB movie dataset with 2 CSV data, one training set and one testing set. there are 22 columns of features for both CSV files, and one additional column for training set: the revenue. The original target of this Kaggle project, is to predict the revenue of testing set by building a model based on the features given.

What I am doing here, includes 4 parts: EDA, EDA report, Feature Engineering, Modeline

this file, EDA, is to walk through each column one by one, and calculate the statistic of these features, explore their distributions and mark the issue, so that we can have a general understanding of this data. It corresponds to step1,2,3 in the guideline

EDA report, is to ask and answer some interesting questions of this dataset, gain the insights and graphs, and make conclusions. It corresponds to step4,5,6 in the guideline

Feature Engineering is afterwards, based on the knowledge we gained from EDA and EDA report. It generates additional features and make it ready for modeling

Modeling, is the final step of this project, where I optimize the model and make the prediction. The evaluation will be performed. A final sumary will be made.
